SocialEyes is a product designed to provide users with a complete analysis of their posts to social media platforms such as Twitter.

Living in an age where we meet more people online than in person, the only image people thousands of miles away have of you, is the image you create through your online activity such as social media posts.

The problem with social media is the very thing that makes it so great: it is literaly at your fingertips. The fact that it is so easy to post virtually anything, at anytime onto Social Media means that people often post simply without thinking, making these decisions impulsively often due to their mood or emotions at one given moment.

Unfortunately, sometimes these posts turn out to contain profanity or other discriminatory or offensive content, meaning that thousands of people across the world now relate the individual to the content he/she posted.

This is why we made SocialEyes.

SocialEyes is a product built upon Google Cloud's Natural Language platform. Once given a Twitter handle, our product is able to scan Twitter for all tweets posted by an individual and after using both the Nautral Language Sentiment Analysis and Content Classification, we are able to flag certain tweets that possibly contain discriminatory/offensive content.
